<p>The following list provides selected literature on group testing. Most papers in the list are published in pre-corona age; it also includes a few examples of coronavirus testing, but we do not attempt to give the latest information on COVID-19 application. We do not attempt to provide a comprehensive historical review either. All references are found free on the web in August 2020.</p>

<p>There are two types of group testing. The first category, hereafter referred as “Type A”, contains methods that aim at efficient identification of infected individuals using pooled samples. The second category, hereafter referred as “Type B”, interested in the estimation of “macroscopic” quantities, such as prevalence of a disease. If positive samples are rare, grouping adequate number of samples can much improve the efficiency of the estimation.</p>

<p>A comprehensive, well-cited review on theoretical aspects of Type A group testing. In Sec 1.7, applications of group testing is listed, which provide examples other than screening of a disease.</p>

<p>An application of multistage group testing to HIV screening is proposed. Sensitivity and specificity of the test are discussed; the importance of the assumption of independence among tests is stressed in Sec 4.</p>

<p>This paper proposes the use of a matrix testing, while many of the application to SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing seems to use a simple Dorfman procedure. Discussion on the possible difficulties in actual implementation of complex group testing methods is given.</p>

<p>One of the pioneering studies on Type B group testing. A simple two-stage test is discussed with maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and its variance. [ Gibbs and Gower (1960) Annals of Applied Biology 48, 75-83 ] seems published earlier, but I have not seen their paper.</p>

<p>A good introduction on Type B group testing, which discuss multistage tests and their medical applications. It is quite readable, but the derivation of maximum likelihood estimator for multistage tests seems unnecessarily complicated.</p>

<p>MLE in Type B group testing is sometimes considerably biased, although multistage method could partially resolve the problem. In Sec 3 of this paper, references on this problem are given, which will be useful for implementation.</p>
