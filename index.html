<p>The following list provides selected literature on group testing. All references here are found free on the web in August 2020.</p>
<p>This page is created as an appendix of my essay on JPS homepage, which introduces the paper:</p>
<p>A Sakata(2020) <a href="https://journals.jps.jp/doi/10.7566/JPSJ.89.084001">Bayesian inference of infected patients in group testing with prevalence estimation, J.Phys.Soc.Jpn. 89, 084001</a>.</p>
<p>[See also the preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13323">arXiv:2007.13323</a> which deals with an adaptive version of the algorithm]</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Most papers in the list are published in pre-corona age; it also includes a few examples of coronavirus testing, but we do not attempt to give the latest information on COVID-19 application. We do not attempt to provide a comprehensive historical review either.</p>
<h2 id="two-types-of-group-testing">Two types of group testing</h2>
<p>There are two types of group testing. The first category, hereafter referred as “Type A”, contains methods that aim at efficient identification of infected individuals using pooled samples. The second category, hereafter referred as “Type B”, interested in the estimation of “macroscopic” quantities, such as prevalence of a disease. If positive samples are rare, grouping adequate number of samples can much improve the efficiency of the estimation.</p>

<p>A comprehensive, well-cited review on theoretical aspects of Type A group testing. In Sec 1.7, applications of group testing is listed, which provide examples other than screening of a disease.</p>

<p>A brief introduction from a medical viewpoint. References to various methods of group testing are useful.</p>

<p>An application of multistage group testing to HIV screening is proposed. Sensitivity and specificity of the test are discussed; the importance of the assumption of independence among tests is stressed in Sec 4.</p>

<p>This paper proposes the use of a matrix testing, while many of the application to SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing seems to use a simple Dorfman procedure. Discussion on the possible difficulties in actual implementation of complex group testing methods is given.</p>

<p>Another example of complex group testing for SARS-CoV-2, which is implemented in a clinical study.</p>

<p>This study employ a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for Bayesian analysis of group testing.</p>
<p>Other studies uses the belief propagation (BP) algorithm for Bayesian computation instead of MCMC; see Sakata (2020) referred at the top of this page and references therein; see also [Kanamori, Uehara, and Jimbo, Journal of Statistical Theory and Practice, 6, 220-238 (2012)].</p>
<p>Knill et al.(1996) and Kanamori et al. (2012) referred above also provide examples of group testing in DNA library screening. There are considerable number of studies on group testing in this field.</p>

<p>One of the pioneering studies on Type B group testing. A simple two-stage test is discussed with maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and its variance. [ Gibbs and Gower (1960) Annals of Applied Biology 48, 75-83 ] seems published earlier, but I have not seen their paper.</p>

<p>A good introduction on Type B group testing, which discuss multistage tests and their medical applications. It is quite readable, but the derivation of maximum likelihood estimator for multistage tests seems unnecessarily complicated.</p>

<p>MLE in Type B group testing is sometimes considerably biased, although multistage method could partially resolve the problem. In Sec 3 of this paper, references on this problem are given, which will be useful for implementation.</p>
